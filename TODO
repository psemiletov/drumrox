KITS THAT NOT WORKING

Alesis_HR16_chaserKit - wrong parse, show one unnamed instrument
acustica_percussoes - crash at Adroud

* some instruments can be not fully working after kit change, for example:

ColomboAcousticDrumkit - //Share (1) muted
Kawai_R100kit // 35Kick (0) - muted
The Black Pearl 1.0 // Pearl Snare (2) muted
