Drumrox 2.0.0

Hello!
This release of Drumrox differs from DrMr more than 1.x
What is new?
+ New drum kit loader. Written in C++, uses pugixml to parse kits (was: C/libexpat).
* The save state is not full compatible with Drumrox 1.0, but projects loads well (just re-select the drumkit). Now Drumrox simple saves the path to the drumkit, not the symlink.
+ Less CPU consumption.
* Simplified CMakeList.txt.
+ Compiler optimization flags.
* Default panning mode is "sin/cos panner, law: -3 dB".
- Unused code
