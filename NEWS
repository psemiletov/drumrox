Drumrox 3.1.0 (multi-layers for Drumrox format)

Hello!

After the implementation of multi-layered samples support for Hydrogen kits, I made the similar thing for Drumrox own kit format. As the example you can try a new kit TamilMulti at https://github.com/psemiletov/drumrox-kits. There also a simple "Tamil" kit without multi-layered samples. I'm big fan of Tamil movies, as well as Hindi :)

And speaking about multi-layered samples at Drumrox kits, the syntax at file format as usual simple. For the multi-layered samples, just separate their file names with comma, using the order from "quiet" sample to the "loudest" one (multi-layered samples are the set of samples those differs with the timbre, not the volume):

kick=kick01.wav,kick02.wav,kick03.wav,kick04.wav
snare=share01.wav,share02.wav,share03.wav
hihat opened=hihat01.wav,hihat02.wav
