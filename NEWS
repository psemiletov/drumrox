Drumrox 3.0.0 (multi-out, multi-layers)

Hello!

* After the conversation with Harvey at drumrox telegram community (t.me/drumrox) I've decided to make the multi-channel output version, so here we are - Drumrox-multi. How to use it, please read the brand new Drumrox Manual (https://psemiletov.github.io/drumrox/manual.html).

* This release introduces a proper (I hope) multi-layered samples support, you can try it, for example, with AVL-BlackPearl or AVL-RedZeppelin.

* 3.0.0 can be unstable, so I'll be glad to hear the feedback.
